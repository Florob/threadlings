# Threadlings
This is a collection of small multi-threading exercises for Rust.
It is inspired by [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## How to use
Do the exercises in the order they are numbered.
Single `.rs` files can be compiled with `rustc -O <file.rs>` and then run as `./<file>`.
Sub-directories contain crates and can be compiled and run by calling `cargo run --release` inside them.

## Status
These are largely untested (on learners) and unreviewed.
